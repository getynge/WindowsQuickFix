# Windows Quick Fix
A collection of registry files and powershell scripts I can run to quickly fix things that annoy me about windows 11.

Useful for when reinstalling windows or when windows does it's occasional undoing of user settings.

Notes:

* UninstallWebExperience.ps1 needs to be re-run every time the microsoft store updates stuff, probably also has to be rerun when updating windows but I have not confirmed this
